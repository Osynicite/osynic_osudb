# Introduction

Osynic's OSU!DB parsing part, based on [osu-db](https://crates.io/crates/osu-db) refactoring, mainly did read-write separation and changed the entity structure, recently upgraded the parsing part to nom8, and solved the change of osu!.db in the 20250107 version

# Related Projects

[osynic_serializer](https://github.com/osynicite/osynic_serializer) is an efficient osu! beatmap serialization tool developed based on [osynic_osudb](https://github.com/osynicite/osynic_osudb), supporting FOLDER and OSUDB serialization algorithms; used with [osynic_downloader](https://github.com/osynicite/osynic_downloader) can achieve fast beatmap serialization and multi-device beatmap synchronization.

# Acknowledgement

The main implementation of this project comes from the `osu-db` crate. If you want to say what I did, the main thing is to adjust the project structure according to my personal preferences

osynic_osudb is based on [osu-db](https://crates.io/crates/osu-db) refactoring, mainly doing read-write separation and changing the entity structure, and recently upgrading the parsing part to nom8 and solving the change of osu!.db in the 20250107 version

The `osu-db` is based on the [Unlicense](http://unlicense.org) license. Nevertheless, we also put its license in the licenses folder.

# ü§ù Contribution Guidelines

This library basically retains all the functions of `osu-db`, but my business needs only need to use the OsuDB parsing part, and I have not tested whether other parts are working well

So, if there is any problem with the code, or if you have any suggestions, please submit a PR or Issue, and I will deal with it as soon as possible~

If you want to contribute code, please follow these rules:

- Follow the official Rust coding specifications
- New features must be accompanied by test cases
- Run `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` before submitting
